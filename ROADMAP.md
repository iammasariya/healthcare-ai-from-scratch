# Healthcare AI From Scratch - Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the progression of building a production-grade healthcare AI platform from first principles, demonstrating the essential engineering practices that make AI safe and effective in clinical settings.

## Vision

Build a complete healthcare AI platform that handles real production concerns: prompt versioning, evaluation, safe deployment, monitoring, human feedback, failure handling, governance, and multi-tenant scale.

This is not a tutorial. This is a reference implementation of how healthcare AI systems should be built.

## Guiding Principles

Throughout this series, we maintain:

1. **Production First**: No toy examples, everything production-grade
2. **Healthcare Reality**: Real constraints, real requirements, real risks
3. **Safety First**: Compliance and reliability over speed
4. **Pragmatic Engineering**: Solve real problems, avoid over-engineering
5. **Teach by Doing**: Working code, not theoretical discussions
6. **Incremental Complexity**: Build up systematically, foundation first

Inspired by Stanford HAI's guidance on building safe, secure medical AI platforms.
